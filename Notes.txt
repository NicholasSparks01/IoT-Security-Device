Next Steps
----------
* Use Wireshark and see what typical communication is like
* Maybe use iperf3 to see what the throughput is like
* Overall, see what the packets look like when endpoint is in use


Implementing Firewall
---------------------
1. PF: pfSense uses PF (Packet Filter) system, which allows
	the firewall engine, to monitor and contorl network traffic
	
2. Snort: Open-Source intrusion detection and prevention system
	that can be used to detect and block malicious network traffic


3. create a web interface to view current network traffic

Functional purpose of the firewall
----------------------------------
* Segment endpoint entirely? 
* Allow only IoT endpoints to contact legitimate external IP addresses
